    <p id="p1" class="odd">Iron Man is a fictional superhero from Marvel Comics, created by writer Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. He first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963. The character’s real name is Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist, genius inventor, and philanthropist. Using his incredible intellect and engineering skills, Stark built a powered suit of armor that grants him superhuman strength, advanced weaponry, and the ability to fly.</p>
    <p id="p2" class="even">Tony Stark’s journey as Iron Man began when he was injured and captured during a weapons demonstration gone wrong. With shrapnel lodged near his heart, he was forced to create weapons for his captors. Instead, he built a crude armored suit to keep himself alive and escape captivity. Over time, Stark refined his design into the high-tech, red-and-gold armor known today. His transformation from a self-centered weapons manufacturer to a heroic protector is central to his character’s development.</p>
    <p id="p3" class="odd">Iron Man’s powers come entirely from his armor, which is equipped with repulsor beams, missile systems, flight capability, and an advanced AI assistant. The suit also provides superhuman strength, durability, and life support systems. Stark continually upgrades his armor to face new threats, making him one of the most resourceful and adaptable heroes in the Marvel Universe. Despite lacking natural superpowers, his intelligence, creativity, and determination make him a formidable force.</p>
    <p id="p4" class="even">Iron Man became a household name through the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), with actor Robert Downey Jr. portraying Tony Stark from 2008 to 2019. The Iron Man film (2008) marked the beginning of the MCU, transforming the character into one of the most popular superheroes worldwide. Beyond comics and movies, Iron Man symbolizes innovation, courage, and the belief that even without superhuman abilities, human ingenuity can change the world. His legacy continues to inspire fans across generations.</p>
    <div id="box1">Tony Stark isn’t just Iron Man — he’s also the guy who can walk into a room full of superheroes, most of whom can punch a building in half, and still make himself the center of attention.</div>
    <div id="box2">When Tony’s not saving the world, he’s upgrading his suits — not because he needs to, but because “Version 57” just sounds cooler than “Version 56.”</div>
