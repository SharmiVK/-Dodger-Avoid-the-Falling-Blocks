    <p>Harry Potter is a kid who discovers heâ€™s a wizard, gets free school 
        admission to Hogwarts, and spends most of his time breaking rules 
        but somehow still wins house points. His best friend Ron is confused but loyal, 
        Hermione does all the actual homework (and saves their lives 90% of the time), 
        and the main villain is a noseless guy who just canâ€™t get over losing to a baby. 
        In the end, love, friendship, and a little luck beat dark magic â€” 
        plus a lot of Quidditch in between. ðŸ§¹âš¡ </p>
